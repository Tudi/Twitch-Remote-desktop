If configured well, it will connect to a twitch irc channel. Will continuesly monitor chat. If keywords are found it will act as configured ( ex : move mouse )
It will not start taking actions until it can measure twitch latency. To do this watch your chat with broadcaster. Type "sync1" and wait until you see the chat in video, than write "sync2".
